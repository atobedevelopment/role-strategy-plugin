Greasemonkey Addons
======

The management interface becomes difficult to use with a large number of users and/or roles. 
Several Greasemonkey userscripts exist to make the UI easier to use (Jira issue):

## Jenkins Role Strategy UI enhancer

This userscript adds a tooltip to the checkboxes indicating the row (e.g. user name) and column (e.g. permission).

## Jenkins Role Strategy Role Management Enhancer and Jenkins Role Strategy Role Assignment Enhancer

These userscripts rotate the text in the column title cells on the Role Strategy configuration pages by 90 degrees so they use less horizontal space. 
Additionally, the first (header) column is repeated at the end of the table.
